# Checkers

A minimal example of using d3 to reactively bind DOM elements to a Meteor collection
Here it is used to simulate a game of checkers. No rules are imposed, pieces can be freely moved but those moves are shared instantly with everyone that has the page open. Check out a live demo at checkers.meteor.com
